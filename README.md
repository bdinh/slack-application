### Project Description: 
By utilizing react-router and Firebase, I was able create a single-page messaging application that resembles
that of the [Slack](https://slack.com/). The design and features of the application derives from Slack 
with minor subtle adjustments. This was intentional and was primarily used as a means of implementation
practice. This messaging application supports private and public channels with a feature that supports adding
new users to respective channels. Users are also allowed to edit and delete messages that are created by them.
